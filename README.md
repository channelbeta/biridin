## Pre conditions (Requirements?)

Install Arch Linux ARM for your version of Raspberry Pi:

- [Zero/1](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi)

- [2B](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/broadcom/raspberry-pi-2)

- [3B/3B+](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-3)

- [4B](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-4)

Tip: Arch Linux ARM doesn't provide an `.img` file that can be "burned" to your SD card. If you have multiple Pis, assuming all sdcards are of the same size, do the process on one card and then copy it to the others.

Alert: You must do this from a Linux box (or any other OS that supports the ext4 file system in fsdisk).
